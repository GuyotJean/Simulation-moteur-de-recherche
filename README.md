# GitHub User Explorer

GitHub User Explorer is a React application that allows users to search for GitHub profiles, view basic user information, repositories, and organizations. This project is primarily a learning and experimental project, so it’s not fully polished.

⚠️ **Note:** This application requires a GitHub personal access token to function. Without it, fetching user data and repositories will not work. The token should be stored in a `.env` file in the root of your project.
